This is a work in progress. While it is nearly complete, on the complaints side the inspections side remains to be addded and testing is still in progress.

Facility complaint forms have been thouroughly stressed by the import procedure as I have it fill out a form, open the form and save the complaint as if a user were doing the same thing. This is slower than it would be otherwise but at the end I'm sure the forms are solid.

Creating new complaints has been lightly tested but not in the last few commits and a few things aren't working I'm sure.

The All/Open/Closed complaints reports are unecessarily slow to open after several hundred records are entered and I am working to correct this now. I've improved the speed of the query procedures by 4000% per record already.

Two linked tables are missing in the required files. I'll add a compiled version with populated tables, etc soon.
